# Sol_advance_3

This is an Anchor Framework program crafted for executing token Airdrop, Staking, and Unstaking operations.

## Description

This smart contract is developed on the Devnet using the Anchor framework. Additionally, a client program is included for the purpose of testing and engaging with the smart contract.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To execute the program, kindly do these instructions:

Click on `Build & Deploy (Ctrl+Shift+B)`

**Build**

Click on `Build`.

**Deploy**

Click on `Deploy`.

After completing the steps, you can engage with the contract by executing the following command:

Go to main project explorer and click on `Test`.

Execution will initiate the anchor.test.ts file, where all three functions will be invoked sequentially. Firstly, accounts will be created using the program, followed by calling the airdrop function twice. Subsequently, tokens will be staked in both scenarios, and then unstaked similarly, with the resulting numbers displayed in the program logs.
